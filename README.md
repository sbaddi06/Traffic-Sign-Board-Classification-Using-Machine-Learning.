# Traffic-Sign-Board-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning.
# Problem Statement
To implement sign board recognition for warning, stop and yield classes using deep learning, machine learning and self-supervised learning algorithms.
# Summary
- Number of dataset collected : 6050.
- Number of classes with appropriate labels: 3 (‘STOP’, ‘WARNING’, ‘YIELD’).
- Describe your dataset in a paragraph : The dataset collected is captured uniformly in 4:3 ratio. We have avoided zooming in and reduced the noise as much as possible. “Rule of thirds” (an image is broken down into thirds, so that we have 9 parts in total) is followed throughout the entire process. The background maintained is either green or white so as to help with easier classification. The dataset captured for each class on an average is 2000. The clarity and focus on the subject is also an important attribute of our dataset collection.
